# 🎓 Q4 AI Class Assignments – GenAI Projects

Welcome to my repository for **Quarter 4 AI Class Assignments**, where I'm actively building hands-on projects focused on Generative AI using modern tools and APIs.

## 📌 Project Overview

This repository contains a series of AI-focused assignments as part of my academic coursework. Each project demonstrates practical implementations of advanced AI concepts, especially in the areas of:

- 🤖 OpenAI SDK (Python)
- 🛠️ Function Calling with Tools
- 🌐 Natural Language Processing
- ⚙️ Prompt Engineering
- 🔄 Asynchronous Programming

These assignments serve as a learning ground for building intelligent, interactive AI applications that understand user input and dynamically respond based on real-time context.

## 💡 What I’ve Built So Far

- **CureCompass Pharmacy Assistant** (AI-powered chatbot using OpenAI & Gemini API)
- Function tools implementation using OpenAI SDK
- Chainlit-based chat interfaces for user interaction

> ⚠️ *More assignments and features will be added soon! This is an active and evolving repository.*

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- 🧠 OpenAI Python SDK
- 🌐 Chainlit UI (for building conversational agents)
- 🔐 Environment Variables for API Security
- 🐍 Python (Async/Await)
- 📄 Markdown + Clean Documentation

## 📚 Learning Outcomes

- Building tool-enabled agents using OpenAI SDK
- Designing structured AI workflows with real-time prompt handling
- Using Gemini/OpenAI models for intelligent suggestions
- Exploring AI use cases in healthcare and other domains
